# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis

The school board received evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically from reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. In order to uphold state-testing standards, they want to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Therefore in the PyCitySchools_Challenge notebook, the suspected math and reading scores were replaced with NaNs and then the school district analysis (from PyCitySchools) was repeated.
